- Can i use my invetend scaler for the pressure equation?
- The bigger the grid size, the more preconditioner sweeps are needed for MGPCG to converge. Why is that?
- Are the defined problems enough for the bachelor thesis?
- Eigenvalue analysis? skip it?
- why when beta is not resetted, it is so fast?
- When using multigrid as a initial guess on the MGPCG, it seems like that the system becomes more well-conditioned, making the CG more stable and less sensitive to variations in the input.
